The Metadata Service provides API for retrieving JSON metadata of GUIDs.

The server is built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and packaged with
[Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/).

[View API Documentation](http://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uc-cdis/metadata-service/master/docs/openapi.yaml)

## Installation

Install required software:

*   [PostgreSQL](PostgreSQL) 9.6 or above
*   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.7 or above
*   [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/#installation)

Then use `poetry install` to install the dependencies. Before that,
a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/) is recommended.
If you don't manage your own, Poetry will create one for you
during `poetry install`, and you must activate it by:

```bash
poetry shell
```

## Development

Create a file `.env` in the root directory of the checkout:
(uncomment to override the default)

```python
# DB_HOST = "..."     # default: localhost
# DB_PORT = ...       # default: 5432
# DB_USER = "..."     # default: current user
# DB_PASSWORD = "..." # default: empty
# DB_DATABASE = "..." # default: current user
```

Run database schema migration:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Run the server with auto-reloading:

```bash
uvicorn mds.asgi:app --reload
```

Try out the API at: <http://localhost:8000/docs>.

## Run tests

```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov=migrations/versions tests
```

Please note that, the name of the test database is prepended with "test_", you
need to create that database too.

## Develop with Docker

Use Docker compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Run database schema migration as well:

```bash
docker-compose exec mds poetry run alembic upgrade head
```

Create test database:

```bash
docker-compose exec db createdb -U mds test_mds
```

Run tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec mds poetry run pytest --cov=src --cov=migrations/versions tests
```

## Deployment

For production, use [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/):

```bash
gunicorn mds.asgi:app -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker
```

Or use the Docker image built from the `Dockerfile`, using environment variables
with the same name to configure the server.

Other than database configuration, please also set:

```bash
DEBUG=0
ADMIN_LOGINS=alice:123,bob:456
```

Except that, don't use `123` or `456` as the password.
